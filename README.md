# World_Weather_Analysis
### Project Overview
The PlanMyTrip app is well received by Jack and Beta testers but have some recommended changes. First, adding the weather description to the weather data retreived in the module. Then, adding input statements for beta testers to filter the data for their weather preferences, helping them identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester will select four cities to create a travel itinerary. By using Google Maps Directions API, we are trasked with creating a travel route between the four cities in addition to a marker layer map.

Deliverables:
- Retrieve Weather Data
- Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
- Create a Travel Itinerary Map
